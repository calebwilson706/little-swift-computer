This text editor is where you [declare variables.]

You use the [dat] keyword followed by a name for your variable, this will [create the variable] with an [initial value of 0.]

For example: [dat test]

You can also [give the variable an initial value] by adding the number to the end of your statement as follows: [dat five 5]

Don't use any numbers in your variable names. If there are any issues with your declarations an error message will be shown when you try to execute your code.

You can still, of course, create and modify variables using the [sta] command in your code.

For example: [sta test] will create the variable test and [give it the value of the accumulator,] if test already exists then its current value will be overwritten by the value in the accumulator.

You can monitor the storing and creation of variables in the [memory registers] section while the program runs press the button below to learn more about this.
