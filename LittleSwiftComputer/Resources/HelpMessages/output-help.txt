This is the [output stack.]

Here you can see a list of numbers which were output by the program.

The [out] command places the value of [the accumulator] to the top of this list.

Most recent output is at the top and the earliest output is at the bottom.

The [output stack] is reset when new the program is started or when you cancel the execution of your program.
