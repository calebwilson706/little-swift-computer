[Assembly code] is a [low level language] which uses mnemonics to represent operations. Assembly code is [compiled by an assembler] which is specifically designed for it's [instruction set.]

To view the [instruction set] for this assembly code simulator press the [LSC Instruction Set] button in the top left corner of the main screen.

Assembly language is not as useful as higher level languages like Swift or Kotlin but it was a vast improvement from binary!

I made the [Little Swift Computer] as a [learning resource] for assembly code as writing in assembly helps you understand exactly how the processor and memory work together to solve problems.
