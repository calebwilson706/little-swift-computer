This is where you write [assembly code.]

The [little swift computer] uses the following instruction set:

[add, sub, sta, lda, out, inp, hlt, bra, brz] and [brp].

For a description of each instruction press the [LSC Instruction Set] button in the top left corner of the main screen.

You write assembly code line by line ensuring each instruction is valid, if there is something not working an error message will be shown to you.

If you place a ['#'] before a line it will be ignored.

A few things to note:

When error messages are shown the line where the error occurs refers to the line of code (white space and comments will not be included).

For instructions which require an operand make sure it comes after the operator such as:

[add myVariable] or
[lda mySecondVariable].

If no operand is given when required there will be an error.

For branch commands you put a [marker] or [placeholder] after the branch command. This will show where you want to branch too. For example:

[bra top]
[brz bottom]
[brp middle]

Then put the corresponding placeholder [before] the line you want to move too:

[top add one]
[middle out]
[bottom hlt]

You can use the same placeholder when branching away from a line but you cannot have the same placeholder in two locations:

so [top add one]
[top sub one]
[bra top]
would not be valid however:

[top add one]
[brz top]
[bra top]
would be [valid].
