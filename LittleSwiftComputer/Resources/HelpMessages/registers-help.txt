These are the [memory registers.]

This grid shows you the current values for each [variable] that has been created with the [dat] command before execution or throughout execution with the [sta] command.

It shows real time updates of the changes made to these [variables.]

However, the values are not shown below the variable name but instead [below the variables index.]

The variable which was created first has index 0 and the next value created has index 1 and so on. Empty registers up to index 99 are also shown.

You can [load the registers values] into the accumulator using the [lda] command and their name such as [lda example].
