[Execution Speed.]

This setting determines how quickly the program completes [instructions,] the slower it runs the easier it is to see the workings of your program.

I recommend using the ['fast'] setting for a nice balance between speed and clarity of how the program works.

[Sound Effects.]

I created unique original sound effects for certain actions and events in [The Little Swift Computer.]

If this setting is turned on then the sound effects will play.
